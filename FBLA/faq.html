                <strong>Finding the right CPA firm can be a daunting task. That is why we, here at Accuracy strive to make your experience more pleasant. Below we have compiled a list of frequently asked questions that might help you make a wise decision. </strong>
                <p class="sub-heading-f">What is a CPA? </p>
                <p>CPA stands for Certified Public Accountant. It is a professional designation used for accountants. There are around 600,000 CPAs in the US but this doesn’t mean it’s an easy feat becoming one. In order to become a "CPA" you must pass a comprehensive exam, meet experience and degree requirements AND pass and adhere to a code of ethics. All our accountants are handpicked from top colleges to make sure that your experience is amazing! </p>
                <p class="sub-heading-f">Who needs a CPA?</p>
                <p>In our opinion, EVERYONE should have a CPA. There is no other professional that is better versed in areas of personal and business finances. We will not only make sure your books are up to date but also help the company grow by reduce costs of high and undeserved taxes.<p>
                        <p class="sub-heading-f">If I'm starting a business, when should I find a CPA? </p>
                        <p>There's never a wrong time to find a CPA, but if you are starting a business, the best time to engage a CPA firm is BEFORE you start. This will give us an opportunity to guide you to a path that will allow for the low taxes and high returns. </p>
                        <p class="sub-heading-f">Do you offer a free initial consultation?</p>
                        <p>Yes, we do offer a free initial consultation. It allows both of us a chance to determine if our services are a good fit to your situation. </p>
                        <p class="sub-heading-f">How do you keep up with the latest tax laws?<p>
                                <p>Tax laws are always changing and keeping up with them can often be a pain. That is why we have a dedicated team responsible for keeping up with the latest laws. This ensures maximum returns and a lowered scope for mistakes. </p>
                                <p class="sub-heading-f">Are you a member of any professional tax or accounting organizations?</p>
                                <p>Yes, our principal is a member of the AICPA (the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants) as well as a member of the NM Society of CPAs. In additional, all of our employees belong to various accountant and/or civic groups. </p>
                                <p class="sub-heading-f">What are your professional credentials?</p>
                                <p>All CPA firms are required to be owned by a licensed Certified Public Accountant. Unfortunately, many firms don’t have certified working in them. This means more often than not important facts are overlooked which often have disastrous outcomes, but Accuracy is different. All our employees are licensed CPAs, thus minimizing the risk of mistakes. </p>
                                <p class="sub-heading-f">How do you determine your fee to prepare my return(s)? Is it a fixed fee or an hourly rate?</p>
                                <p>There are a multitude of factors involved in finding the right price for our services. Most of the services have a fixed price but some of the services are more complicated which are billed hourly. We strive to make accounting affordable and accurate, thus we will go to great lengths to make your experience is both relaxing and affordable. </p>
                                <p class="sub-heading-f">When do you require payment?</p>
                                <p>We know that it is not always possible to have funds at your disposal. Thus we work on both a retainer type arrangement (down payment) or billed upon completion. </p>
                                <p class="sub-heading-f">When can I expect to receive my completed tax returns back from you?</p>
                                <p>We process returns on a First In First Out basis. Due to the complexity of returns, some tax returns can be completed in a day or two and others could take a week or more. If you have a deadline or time frame in mind, let us know and we will work to get your return completed on your time schedule. </p>
                                <p class="sub-heading-f">What happens if I get a notification about my return?</p>
                                <p>It is very common to receive notifications in the mail from the IRS requesting information or notifying you of changes. It is important to address the notices timely. When you receive a notification, please contact the office or send us a copy of your notice immediately. We will be more than happy to help you out will any guidance you might need. If the notice is because of an overlook done on our side we will not charge you for our services. </p>
                                <p><strong>NOTE FROM THE US GOVERNMENT:</strong> The IRS or other tax authority will send a letter to you if there is a problem or question about your tax return. NEVER give your information over the phone or internet. There have been many ongoing scams where someone will pose as the IRS and make threatening allegations of claims or liens. If you get these calls, hang up and report it to your local authorities. </p>
                                <p class="sub-heading-f">Are you registered with the IRS?</p>
                                <p>Yes, our firm is a registered electronic return originator and is authorized to sign returns. </p>
                                <p class="sub-heading-f">Will you store my tax information? How will it be stored and for how long?</p>
                                <p>We store a copy of your your tax return and the working papers to prepare the return electronically for seven years. This makes sure that you don’t lose any crucial documents that might help in the future. During this time your information is kept with utmost privacy. </p>
                                <p class="sub-heading-f">Can I contact you after tax season if needed regarding my return?</p>
                                <p>Of course! A CPA firm is a wealth of information and we hope to establish an ongoing relationship with you and your company. We treat every customer like family and our accountants will be ready to accommodate your needs at any time. If there is an emergency you can contact our 24 hour emergency hotline and we will get back to you with a solution as soon as possible.</p>
                                <p class="sub-heading-f">Who will prepare my return? Will it be you or someone else in your office?</p>
                                <p>Our firm operates on a tiered team based approach. The person you interact with will likely be part of team that will be working on your return. Additionally, a senior accountant will look through all your returns to make sure that nothing was missed. </p>
